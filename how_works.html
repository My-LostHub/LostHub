        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>At Losthub, we’ve made the process of finding or reporting lost items as simple and seamless as possible. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sign Up or Log In</strong><br>Start by creating an account using your college email. Once you’re logged in, you can post items or search for them with ease.</li>
            <li><strong>Report a Lost Item</strong><br>If you’ve lost something, simply fill out a report by providing details like the item’s description, location, and the date it was lost. You can also upload a photo to help others identify it.</li>
            <li><strong>Report a Found Item</strong><br>If you’ve found an item, you can report it by providing a description and uploading a photo. Don’t forget to mention where and when you found it!</li>
            <li><strong>Search for Items</strong><br>Browse the list of found items using filters like category, location, and date. If you think an item might be yours, click on the post for more details and contact the finder through the given contact information.</li>
            <li><strong>Claim or Return an Item</strong><br>Once you’ve connected with the owner or finder, arrange for the item to be picked up at the Lost and Found office or an agreed-upon location. Our system allows you to communicate safely without revealing personal details.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Updated</strong><br>Receive notifications when new items are posted.</li>
        </ol>
